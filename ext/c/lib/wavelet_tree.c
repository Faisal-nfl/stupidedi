/* Wavelet Trees - A Survey
 *
 * An interesting aspect of the [49] construction is that besides using Huffman
 * shaped wavelet trees (note that in this case of already compressed bit
 * dictionaries variations in the tree shape does not seem to affect the total
 * space) a frequency based construction is applied where the wavelet tree is
 * built as an optimal Huffman prefix tree not on the frequency of appearance of
 * the symbols, but on the a-priory distribution of the queries on them.
 */

/* Engineering Rank and Select Queries on Wavelet Trees
 *
 * Julian Shun [9] describes various parallelized algorithms for constructing
 * the wavelet tree by utilizing the GPU, achieving up to a 27x speedup over the
 * sequential construction algorithm.
 *
 * If one knows the frequencies of all symbols in the alphabet, without needing
 * it to be exact, then one can build a Huffman shaped Wavelet Tree (described
 * in Section 4.2.4) and we expect it will beat out any balanced wavelet tree in
 * terms of performance. The frequencies can be found by a simple linear scan of
 * the input string before building the tree
 */

/*
 * Binary wavelet trees encode strings as a perfect binary tree of bit vectors
 * which allows O(log |Σ|) time rank and select queries, where Σ is the size of
 * the alphabet. This requires rank and select queries on each bit vector to be
 * answered in O(1) time, which is made possible using RRR sequences.
 *
 * Using ordinary bit vectors would require |S| log |Σ| bits * where |S| is the
 * string length and |Σ| is the number of symbols.
 *
 * In this particular application, the alphabet typically contains six symbols.
 * Using the files in spec/fixtures as a sample, the relative frequences of each
 * symbol are approximately:
 *
 *   I  the letter I
 *   S  the letter S
 *   A  the letter A
 *   α  graphical character
 *   *  element separator
 *   ~  segment terminator
 *   _  non-graphical character
 *   :  component separator
 *   ^  repetition separator
 *
 *   p(sᵢ = a) = 0.77332 graphical character
 *   p(sᵢ = *) = 0.17135 element separator
 *   p(sᵢ = ~) = 0.03651 segment terminator
 *   p(sᵢ = _) = 0.01284 non-graphical character (\r, \n, etc)
 *   p(sᵢ = :) = 0.00475 component separator
 *   p(sᵢ = ^) = 0.00120 repetition separator
 *
 * The Shannon entropy (H₀) of this distribution is 1.02636 compared to 2.58496,
 * which is the entropy of a uniformly random distribution of six symbols. So
 * we expect RRR sequences to provide some compression. The lower bound on
 * space required is 
 *
 * Taking advantage of the fact these symbols are not i.i.d. could make higher
 * compression possible but the conditional probabilities of the next character
 * given the previous match the marginal probabilities above, at least for the
 * most common conditions.
